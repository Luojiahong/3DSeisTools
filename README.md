#Introduction
This software package is intended to interface Earthquake location and 
focal mechanism inversion routines (using a 3-D velocity model) with a 
CSS3.0 schema database via the Antelope software package distributed by 
BRTT (http://www.brtt.com). This software package is not intimately 
dependant on, but heavily structured around the use of 3D wavefront 
propagation modelling code by Nick Rawlinson 
(http://rses.anu.edu.au/seismology/soft/fmmcode/)
